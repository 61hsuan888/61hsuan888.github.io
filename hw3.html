             <p>
                NTU Rock Club has nurtured many music professionals and renowned musicians over the years, including bands like Major in Body Bear, 
                Elephant Gym, and Runaway Bob. Mayday's guitarist Mr.Monster once served as the president of NTU Rock Club. They've infused youthful 
                vitality into their passionate rock music and used rock melodies to convey unspoken words and emotions. Let's create more possibilities with rock music!
                NTU Rock Club has now entered its 47th year and has grown to approximately 300 members. It's a place where a community of music enthusiasts gathers.

             <p>
                Combo is one of NTU Rock Club's distinctive events, designed as a music concert specifically to provide new members with a performance opportunity. Despite its name, 
                it is primarily focused on showcasing performances, and it invites five judges to assess the proficiency of each instrument and the band's overall compatibility. 
                The judges offer constructive feedback and, in the end, select the best band and best musician.
                Each judge is a highly skilled and experienced musician in their respective instrument, including Lum Guang-Ling, who has been a vocal instructor at NTU Rock Club for many years.

             <p>
                The Night is the club's end-of-semester showcase, held in early June, and it's a collective memory for university students. 
                NTU Rock Club organizes The Night to provide a stage for its members to perform and showcase their year-long accomplishments. 
                It also invites family and friends to come and watch, allowing everyone to enjoy the music and sway to the rhythm to their heart's content.

             <p>
                The Singing Lecture Concert is an event where the audience can simultaneously listen to lectures and watch performances. 
                This year, we invited the Old Breaker Band to share the theme of music composition. The band's lead singer also shared many of the challenges 
                and difficulties he encountered during the creative process and how he overcame them. Additionally, he provided insights into stage performance techniques, 
                helping everyone prepare for the end-of-semester showcase.
                The second half of the event featured performances by the bands, including well-known songs and high-energy rock music. The audience swayed and sang along with the music, 
                making it a truly memorable and impressive event.
